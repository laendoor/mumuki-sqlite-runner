# Mumuki Sqlite Runner

SQLite Runner to integrate into the [Plataforma Mumuki](https://mumuki.io/).

This project was originally made as Final Project for my Technical Degree in Computer Programming at Universidad Nacional de Quilmes.

In this [Wiki](https://github.com/leandrojdl/mumuki-sqlite-runner/wiki) you can see the information about the final project.

But the project itself was moved to [mumuki/mumuki-sqlite-runner](https://github.com/mumuki/mumuki-sqlite-runner).
